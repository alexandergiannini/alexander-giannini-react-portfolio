# Alexander Giannini React Portfolio

# Hi there! My name is Alexander Giannini and this is my portfolio page, built with React.js! This portfolio is specifically to promote my developer skills for future employers to examine and connect me with potential opportunities! The portfolio includes an "About Me" section, along with a portfolio section with some of the projects that I have worked on, with a contact form for those who would like to contact me, along with a resume section with a link to my resume along with my frontend and backend proficiences. You can easily navigate around the website with the Navigation bar. This is also the first application that I have built using React.js, which is super intuitive and easy to use. Hope you enjoy!
